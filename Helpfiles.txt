+help/addmain PennMUSH/Pueblo=Pueblo is an extra feature that lets Pueblo-compatible clients support special text features. Namely, clicking on text that shows up on your screen.%R%RExalted MUSH is a Pueblo-enhanced world. While it is hardly necessary, it is nevertheless handy.%R%RPueblo-enabled clients are rare, however. For Windows, there is MUSHclient and the old original Pueblo.%R%RMUSHclient enables Pueblo by default. It can be turned off or otherwise modified by going to your client's configuration. In MUSHclient, that's Game > Configure > MXP/Pueblo (also accessible via ctrl+alt+U).%R%RWe highly recommend turning off local echo text and custom link colors as we use our own colors and otherwise all you will see is hyperlink blue.%R%RPueblo is detected and enabled upon connection to the MUSH.

+help/addmain PennMUSH/Room Objects=Players are allowed - and encouraged - to create their own rooms. Most rooms on the game were created using @dig, making them full-fledged Rooms. @dig however, requires admin powers to use, because of how easily it can mess up the game's rooms if misused. However, there is another way to create what are essentially 'rooms.'%R%RPlayers may make Objects, place these in a room, give them a room description and allow others to enter them. They work in almost all ways like a true Room, save that they can be personalized, restricted, and so on. The following is a basic tutorial on how these work.%R%RCONCEPT EXPLANATION: Targeting objects and DBrefs. All things - rooms, players, exits, and so on - have a DBREF, or 'Database Reference.' It is like an ID code. When you use commands such as 'look <name>' PennMUSH checks to see if there is anything of that name in the same location as you. You could, in theory, also use look #800 to look at object #800. Such things are interchangeable for code purposes. Some words can be used to substitute things-- such as 'me' or 'here.' 'me' will always be YOUR dbref, which is why &short-desc me=<your short desc> works. here will refer to your current location. For the purposes of this tutorial, <target> will refer to the object's name or DBREF (if you are outside it or have it in your inventory) or using here (if you are inside it.)%R%R[ansi(h,@create <name>)] - this will make an object and place it in your inventory.%R[ansi(h,@nuke <name or DBREF>)] - this will destroy an object. Using just once will mark it for destruction, which can be undone with [ansi(h,@undestroy <name or dbref>)] if it is typed quickly. Using twice will annihilate object. This cannot be undone.%R%R[ansi(h,@set <target>=ENTER_OK)] - this will set a flag on the object that will allow other people to enter it. Using !ENTER_OK instead will remove the flag. (You may always enter your own objects.)%R%R[ansi(h,inventory)] - this will show what's in your inventory.%R[ansi(h,drop <target>)] - this will remove an object from your inventory and place it in the room.%R[ansi(h,get <target>)] - this will retrieve an object, if you have permission.%R[ansi(h,@lock/Basic <target>=me)] - this will prevent other players from picking up and walking off with your object.%R[ansi(h,\(\IMPORTANT: see +help +key for more advanced tricks!))]%R%R[ansi(h,@desc <target>=<text here>)] - the same as @describe'ing yourself. This will be what others see if they look at or are inside the object. You may also use @idesc for 'internal description,' in which case @desc will be seen by those looking at the object, rather than being both the external description and a room description.%R%R[ansi(h,&IC <target>=1)] - this will enable +pot to work in an object.%R%RYou may only have a few objects in existence at once. If you have lost track of them:%R[ansi(h,@search)] - this will show all objects you own and their DBREFs.%R[ansi(h,@tel <target>=me)] - this will retrieve an object.%R%RUsing them:%R[ansi(h,enter <target>)] - this will enter an object as though it were a room.%R[ansi(h,leave <target>)] - This will leave the object.

+help/addmain PennMUSH/Connection Troubles=Every now and then, someone joins the game who might have problems staying connected. The following advice will help you if that problem matches this symptom: you type nothing for a minute or two, and the game stops sending you text-- when you type something, it suddenly says you're disconnected.%r%rThis is a problem typical of those behind NAT (Network Address Translation)... in other words, routers and large networks.%r%rTo solve this problem:%r%r[ansi(h,@set me=KEEPALIVE)]%rThis will tell the game to work harder to keep the connection to your character open. There is also the option of setting a timer in your client (check your client's Help files for instructions on doing so) that sends IDLE (all capitals! iDLE or idle will not work) to the game every minute or two.%r%rThis will only solve problems related to a lack of activity causing the hardware to invisibly disconnect you. There are some problems it cannot solve.

+help/addsub BBS/timeout=There's only a couple of things that need to be understood in order to take full advantage of message timeouts.%R%R1: Once a day, the TR_TIMEOUT attribute on the bbpocket should be triggered. Some games already have a way of accomplishing this. For games that do not, simply have a wizard execute set the 'autotimeout' global parameter: [ansi(h,+bbconfig autotimeout=on)]%RTurning that parameter on sets up the board to take care of its own daily triggering.  Setting the paramenter to 'off' turns off the BBS's internal triggering.%R%R2: There are 3 different timeout values:%R%RThe global parameter 'timeout' (set via the '+bbconfig timeout=<days>' command) sets a default timeout that will be set on any new bb groups created after the execution of this command.%R%RThe group parameter 'timeout' (set via the '+bbconfig <#>/timeout=<days>' command) sets a default timeout for the group <#>. Any new messages posted to this group will inherit that timeout.%R%RThe user command '+bbtimeout <group>/<message list>=<days>' will set the specified timeout on individual messages. Players can only modify their own messages, wizards can modify any messages. Players can only set timeouts equal to or less than the default timeout for the board, wizards can set any timeout.%R%RIn all cases, a timeout of '0' indicates no timeout.
