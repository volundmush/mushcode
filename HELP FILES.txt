'me' will always be YOUR dbref, which is why &short-desc me=<your short desc> works. here will refer to your current location.

(You may always enter your own objects.)%R%R[ansi(h,inventory)] - this will show what's in your inventory.%R[ansi(h,drop <target>)] - this will remove an object from your inventory and place it in the room.%R[ansi(h,get <target>)] - this will retrieve an object, if you have permission.%R[ansi(h,@lock/Basic <target>=me)] - this will prevent other players from picking up and walking off with your object.%R[ansi(h,\(\IMPORTANT: see +help +key for more advanced tricks!))]%R%R[ansi(h,@desc <target>=<text here>)] - the same as @describe'ing yourself.

+help/addmain Technical/Connection Troubles=Every now and then, someone joins the game who might have problems staying connected. The following advice will help you if that problem matches this symptom: you type nothing for a minute or two, and the game stops sending you text-- when you type something, it suddenly says you're disconnected.%r%rThis is a problem typical of those behind NAT (Network Address Translation)... in other words, routers and large networks.%r%rTo solve this problem:%r%r[ansi(h,@set me=KEEPALIVE)]%rThis will tell the game to work harder to keep the connection to your character open. There is also the option of setting a timer in your client (check your client's Help files for instructions on doing so) that sends IDLE (all capitals! iDLE or idle will not work) to the game every minute or two.%r%rThis will only solve problems related to a lack of activity causing the hardware to invisibly disconnect you. There are some problems it cannot solve.
