&HLP`ROOMOBJ u(help)=Players are allowed - and encouraged - to create their own rooms. Most rooms on the game were created using @dig, making them full-fledged Rooms. @dig however, requires admin powers to use, because of how easily it can mess up the game's rooms if misused. However, there is another way to create what are essentially 'rooms.'%R%RPlayers may make Objects, place these in a room, give them a room description and allow others to enter them. They work in almost all ways like a true Room, save that they can be personalized, restricted, and so on. The following is a basic tutorial on how these work.%R%RCONCEPT EXPLANATION: Targeting objects and DBrefs. All things - rooms, players, exits, and so on - have a DBREF, or 'Database Reference.' It is like an ID code. When you use commands such as 'look <name>' PennMUSH checks to see if there is anything of that name in the same location as you. You could, in theory, also use look #800 to look at object #800. Such things are interchangeable for code purposes. Some words can be used to substitute things-- such as 'me' or 'here.' 'me' will always be YOUR dbref, which is why &short-desc me=<your short desc> works. here will refer to your current location. For the purposes of this tutorial, <target> will refer to the object's name or DBREF (if you are outside it or have it in your inventory) or using here (if you are inside it.)%R%R[ansi(h,@create <name>)] - this will make an object and place it in your inventory.%R[ansi(h,@nuke <name or DBREF>)] - this will destroy an object.

This cannot be undone.%R%R[ansi(h,@set <target>=ENTER_OK)] - this will set a flag on the object that will allow other people to enter it. Using !ENTER_OK instead will remove the flag. (You may always enter your own objects.)%R%R[ansi(h,inventory)] - this will show what's in your inventory.%R[ansi(h,drop <target>)] - this will remove an object from your inventory and place it in the room.%R[ansi(h,get <target>)] - this will retrieve an object, if you have permission.%R[ansi(h,@lock/Basic <target>=me)] - this will prevent other players from picking up and walking off with your object.%R[ansi(h,\(\IMPORTANT: see +help +key for more advanced tricks!))]%R%R[ansi(h,@desc <target>=<text here>)] - the same as @describe'ing yourself. This will be what others see if they look at or are inside the object. You may also use @idesc for 'internal description,' in which case @desc will be seen by those looking at the object, rather than being both the external description and a room description.%R%R[ansi(h,&IC <target>=1)] - this will enable +pot to work in an object.%R%RYou may only have a few objects in existence at once.

+help/addmain Technical/Connection Troubles=[u(help)]/HLP`CONNECTIONTROUBLES
&HLP`CONNECTIONTROUBLES u(help)=Every now and then, someone joins the game who might have problems staying connected. The following advice will help you if that problem matches this symptom: you type nothing for a minute or two, and the game stops sending you text-- when you type something, it suddenly says you're disconnected.%r%rThis is a problem typical of those behind NAT (Network Address Translation)... in other words, routers and large networks.%r%rTo solve this problem:%r%r[ansi(h,@set me=KEEPALIVE)]%rThis will tell the game to work harder to keep the connection to your character open. There is also the option of setting a timer in your client (check your client's Help files for instructions on doing so) that sends IDLE (all capitals! iDLE or idle will not work) to the game every minute or two.%r%rThis will only solve problems related to a lack of activity causing the hardware to invisibly disconnect you. There are some problems it cannot solve.

+help/addmain Roleplaying/+summary=Usage: +summary <message>%R%RDisplays <message> in highlights along with your name and a note that it's a summary. This is to summarize long poses for use by both your fellow players as well as your game master (if the scene has a game master), in order to better help have an idea of what's going on. It's use in large scenes is STRONGLY encouraged. It's also used to keep track of who's posed in a given pose round, if a scene is using pose rounds.%R%RNote that <message> is meant to be short and very to the point. It shouldn't be more than two or three lines. The command will refuse to display messages that are over a certain limit.

+help/addmain Roleplaying/+done=Usage: +done%R%RDisplays a highlighted message that you are 'done'. This is usually used to keep track of who's posed in large scenes, for the convenience of the game master (if applicable) as well as other players. This is especially useful when pose rounds are being used.
