It's also helpful to enclose your actual text in curly braces \{\} if you're going to include commas in it. An example: \[ansi(hr,\{behold, this text is red\})\] results in [ansi(hr,{behold, this text is red})]%R%RLooking for more advanced formatting tricks?

&SHLP`ROOMFEATURES [u(cobj,help-dynamic)]=Exits with an alias that consists of part of its name will have that part displayed in colored <>. For example, making an exit named North with the alias n will result in a <N>orth. The alias shortcut color is stored in the attribute VAR`ALIASCOLOR on the ancestor room. Setting one on a local room overrides it.%R%RExits sort and display alphabetically. They can have an 'ORDER' attribute that has a number in it which overrides this sorting based on the number, however if ANY Exit in the room has such an attribute then ALL must have it.

+help/add Room Objects=[u(cobj,help-dynamic)]/HLP`ROOMOBJ
+help/category Room Objects=Technical
&HLP`ROOMOBJ [u(cobj,help-dynamic)]=Players are allowed - and encouraged - to create their own rooms. Most rooms on the game were created using @dig, making them full-fledged Rooms. @dig however, requires admin powers to use, because of how easily it can mess up the game's rooms if misused. However, there is another way to create what are essentially 'rooms.'%R%RPlayers may make Objects, place these in a room, give them a room description and allow others to enter them. They work in almost all ways like a true Room, save that they can be personalized, restricted, and so on. The following is a basic tutorial on how these work.%R%RCONCEPT EXPLANATION: Targeting objects and DBrefs. All things - rooms, players, exits, and so on - have a DBREF, or 'Database Reference.' It is like an ID code. When you use commands such as 'look <name>' PennMUSH checks to see if there is anything of that name in the same location as you. You could, in theory, also use look #800 to look at object #800. Such things are interchangeable for code purposes. Some words can be used to substitute things-- such as 'me' or 'here.' 'me' will always be YOUR dbref, which is why &short-desc me=<your short desc> works. here will refer to your current location. For the purposes of this tutorial, <target> will refer to the object's name or DBREF (if you are outside it or have it in your inventory) or using here (if you are inside it.)%R%R[ansi(h,@create <name>)] - this will make an object and place it in your inventory.%R[ansi(h,@nuke <name or DBREF>)] - this will destroy an object. Using just once will mark it for destruction, which can be undone with [ansi(h,@undestroy <name or dbref>)] if it is typed quickly. Using twice will annihilate object. This cannot be undone.%R%R[ansi(h,@set <target>=ENTER_OK)] - this will set a flag on the object that will allow other people to enter it. Using !ENTER_OK instead will remove the flag. (You may always enter your own objects.)%R%R[ansi(h,inventory)] - this will show what's in your inventory.%R[ansi(h,drop <target>)] - this will remove an object from your inventory and place it in the room.%R[ansi(h,get <target>)] - this will retrieve an object, if you have permission.%R[ansi(h,@lock/Basic <target>=me)] - this will prevent other players from picking up and walking off with your object.%R[ansi(h,\(\IMPORTANT: see +help +key for more advanced tricks!))]%R%R[ansi(h,@desc <target>=<text here>)] - the same as @describe'ing yourself. This will be what others see if they look at or are inside the object. You may also use @idesc for 'internal description,' in which case @desc will be seen by those looking at the object, rather than being both the external description and a room description.%R%R[ansi(h,&IC <target>=1)] - this will enable +pot to work in an object.%R%RYou may only have a few objects in existence at once. If you have lost track of them:%R[ansi(h,@search)] - this will show all objects you own and their DBREFs.%R[ansi(h,@tel <target>=me)] - this will retrieve an object.%R%RUsing them:%R[ansi(h,enter <target>)] - this will enter an object as though it were a room.%R[ansi(h,leave <target>)] - This will leave the object.
